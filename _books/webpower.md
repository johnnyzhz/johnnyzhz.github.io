The importance of conducting a statistical power analysis at the beginning of a study is universally accepted. Without careful planning, a study can easily fail to detect an existing effect by chance. This book teaches how to conduct power analysis for a range of models from correlation and t-test to structural equation models and multilevel models. Both a graphical Web software WebPower and an R package are introduced to practically conduct the analysis. The book is suitable for researchers and graduate students in psychology, education, social sciences, health sciences, and other related fields.
